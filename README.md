Examples and exercises of Advanced Parallel Programming, in C. The exercises was implemented gradually in complexity level and with greater requirements. The exercises are distributed by the following:

001-matrizSeq: 
- Implement a library to manipulate matrixes of integer in C.

002-matrizSeq
- Implement a library with matrix sum and multiplication operations.

003-matrizSeq
- Implement procedures to multiplicate matrixes in blocks.

004-pthreads-prod
- Parallelizing the implementation of matrix multiplication, sequential and in blocks.

007-OpenMP
- Parallelizing the implementation of matrix multiplication, sequential and in block using OpenMP.

008-mpi
- Parallelizing the implementation of matrix multiplication, sequential and in blocks using MPI.

pointer-manipulation:
- Exercises to practice the pointer manipulation in C.
